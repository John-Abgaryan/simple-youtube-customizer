Take full control over your YouTube viewing experience with a sleek, minimalist, and powerful design engine. **Simple Youtube Customizer** allows you to strip away the default look and create a workspace that perfectly matches your mood, aesthetic, or OS theme.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Infinite Color Possibilities**: Customize the main theme, background, headers, and even the filter chips with a full-spectrum color picker.
*   **Smart "Honey White" Light Mode**: Includes a hand-crafted light theme inspired by soft cream/honey tones for a warmer, easier-on-the-eyes experience than default white.
*   **Custom Brand Logo**: Replace the YouTube logo with your own branding, a custom image URL, or any high-resolution PNG/SVG.
*   **Intelligent Text Contrast**: Built-in luminance algorithms automatically swap text colors between obsidian black and arctic white so your site remains readable no matter how bright or dark your theme is.
*   **One-Click Randomizer**: Feeling uninspired? Use the theme-aware randomization wand to generate a perfectly balanced dark or light palette instantly.
*   **Ultra-Smooth Transitions**: Experience premium-feeling 0.5s fade transitions whenever you switch themes or colors—no harsh flickering.
*   **Sidebar & Scrollbar Polish**: Every detail is covered, down to matching the sidebar scrollbars to your custom header colors for a unified look.
